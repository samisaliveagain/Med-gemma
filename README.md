My learnings from Learning the Google DeepMind's state of the art model to read X-ray and images for dermatalogical purposes. We used a sample image from a known private source of chest x-ray. Also we used the model with 4B params. The 27 Params model requires HPC (High performance computing) and has proven to be better than radiologists


It is preferd to run this model on the google colab and get the model from the hugging face : https://huggingface.co/collections/google/medgemma-release-680aade845f90bec6a3f60c4
