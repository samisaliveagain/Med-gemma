My learnings from Learning the Google DeepMind's state of the art model to read X-ray and images for dermatalogical purposes. We used a sample image from a known private source of chest x-ray. Also we used the model with 4B params. The 27 Params model requires HPC (High performance computing) and has proven to be better than radiologists
